Welcome to Paper Garden! This project serves as a basic landscape architecture app, originally designed for use by my wife.

To use, you may choose to log in or not. Select the green 'Start Garden' button, and enter the dimensions of the garden you want to design. Your plot will be drawn after you submit your dimensions, at which time you may add plants to your garden. Click the add plants button to enter a name and spread(width) for your plant. Once you hit submit, your plant will be drawn and can be dragged and dropped wherever you would like on your garden. Your plant is automatically a circle, and will be scaled relative to the garden plot.

When you're done with your garden, you can save your image by taking a screenshot (cmd + shift + 4 on Mac).

Issues/Next Steps:
Add images to Readme
Continue to fix removing plants - instead of saving plants to state, save plants to database and make a fetch call to render the database's plants when a new plant is added.
Save projects - adding plants to database will make saving projects easier. Plants in database need access to current project name and/or user name. Save project button should exist, not just "Untitled" name to save project.
Add ability to resize garden
